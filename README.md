We study the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model defined on multiple lattices. 

Our study of the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17144

Our study of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20406
